Thank you for using the Error AI Bot.

Please contact Error AI through the Error AI Bot.


- Messages sent to the bot by other users will be forwarded to the bot creator.
- When users reply with regular text to a forwarded message, the reply will be sent back to the original message sender.
- If users reply with commands such as `/block`, `/unblock`, or `/checkblock`, the relevant commands will be executed, but **will not** be sent back to the original message sender.
